Starting planning the next major redesign of the scanner - planning on going back to optical - but combination optical/mechanical using occlusion not Time Of Flight.

## KY-008 ##

https://arduinomodules.info/ky-008-laser-transmitter-module/

This module consists of a 650nm red laser diode head, a resistor and 3 male header pins. Handle with caution, do not point the laser beam directly to the eyes.

Operating Voltage	5V

Connect the module signal pin (S) to pin 13 on the Arduino and ground (-) to GND.

The middle pin on the module is not used.


## Receiver ##
Laser Receiver Sensor Module non-modulator Tube Pi Arduino Pic Lazer

The laser receiver sensor module uses a non-modulated laser receiver to detect the laser signal.

For use indoors where there is no light, sunlight or other sources of light which will interfere with the sensor, recommended for use in dark environments.
