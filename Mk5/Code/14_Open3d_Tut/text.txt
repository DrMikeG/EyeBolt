By default, Open3D tries to infer the file type by the filename extension. The following point cloud file types are supported:

xyz - Each line contains [x, y, z], where x, y, z are the 3D coordinates

xyzn - Each line contains [x, y, z, nx, ny, nz], where nx, ny, nz are the normals

xyzrgb - Each line contains [x, y, z, r, g, b], where r, g, b are in floats of range [0, 1]

pts - The first line is an integer representing the number of points. The subsequent lines follow one of these formats: [x, y, z, i, r, g, b], [x, y, z, r, g, b], [x, y, z, i] or [x, y, z], where x, y, z, i are of type double and r, g, b are of type uint8

ply - See Polygon File Format, the ply file can contain both point cloud and mesh data
