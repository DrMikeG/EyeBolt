I estimate 30mm to be an average of 2770 steps

I think the lead-screw is 2mm for 20 teeth
I think the belt drive is 1:1
The motor is 200 steps per revolution
30mm should be 3000 steps
01mm should be 100 steps
I this suggests the fuzz (region of uncertainty) at each end of my block is 1.15mm

This might have been before I discovered I could focus....

Happy with this, and the consistent movement in steps of 10 - how can it be improved?

Is there an offset or a reduction I'm not aware off?
It is the beam width? Can I just compensate for that? Does it always measure small?
